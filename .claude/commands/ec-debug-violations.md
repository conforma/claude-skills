# EC Debug All Violations

Parse a Conforma validation log file, extract all violations, and debug each unique violation using the ec-policy-debugging skill methodology.

## Instructions

Arguments in `$ARGUMENTS`:
- **First argument** (required): Log source - one of:
  - **Local file**: `./path/to/log.txt` or `/absolute/path/to/log.txt`
  - **Kubernetes TaskRun**: `taskrun://namespace/taskrun-name`
- **--policy** (optional): Path or URL to policy.yaml config file
  - Local file: `./policy.yaml` or `/path/to/policy.yaml`
  - GitHub URL: `https://github.com/org/repo/blob/main/policy.yaml`
- **--setup-dir** (optional): Path to setup directory created by `/ec-setup`

If no log source is provided, prompt the user for it.

## Supported Log Formats

This skill supports two log formats:

### 1. TaskRun/PipelineRun Format (JSON)
Output from Tekton taskRuns or pipelineRuns. Contains JSON starting with `{"success"` with structure:
- `components[].violations[].metadata.code` - Violation codes
- `components[].violations[].msg` - Violation messages
- `components[].warnings[].metadata.code` - Warning codes

### 2. Text Output Format
Human-readable output from `ec validate` or similar tools. Identified by:
- Header with `Success:`, `Result:`, `Violations:` counts
- `Components:` section listing images
- `Results:` section with entries like:
  ```
  ✕ [Violation] package.rule_name
    ImageRef: ...
    Reason: ...
    Title: ...
    Description: ...
    Solution: ...
  ```

The summarize script auto-detects the format.

## Step 1: Fetch and Parse the Log

### Determine log source type

Parse the first argument to determine the source:

**If `taskrun://namespace/taskrun-name`**:
1. Extract namespace and taskrun name from the URI
2. Fetch logs from the Kubernetes cluster:
   ```bash
   # Get the pod name for the taskrun
   POD=$(kubectl get taskrun <taskrun-name> -n <namespace> -o jsonpath='{.status.podName}')

   # Fetch logs from the step-detailed-report container (contains the violations report)
   kubectl logs -n <namespace> $POD -c step-detailed-report
   ```
3. Save the output to a temporary file for processing

**If local file path**:
1. Read the file directly

### Parse the log content

The script auto-detects whether this is JSON or text format.

Use the summarize script to get an overview:
```bash
python3 .claude/skills/ec-policy-debugging/summarize_violations.py <LOG_FILE>
```

## Step 2: Extract Unique Violation Codes

Collect all unique violation codes. The format determines how to extract them:

**JSON format**: Extract from `components[].violations[].metadata.code` and `components[].warnings[].metadata.code`

**Text format**: Extract from `✕ [Violation] <code>` and `! [Warning] <code>` lines in the Results section

Group violations by their code (e.g., `olm.unmapped_references`, `rpm_packages.unique_version`).

## Step 3: Locate Policy Source Code

The policy source is needed to read rule definitions, metadata, and tests. Find it using this priority order:

### If --policy was provided:

1. **Fetch the policy config file**:
   - **Local file**: Read directly with the Read tool
   - **GitHub URL**: Convert to raw URL and fetch with WebFetch
     - `https://github.com/org/repo/blob/main/policy.yaml` → `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/org/repo/main/policy.yaml`

2. **Parse the policy.yaml** to extract policy sources from `sources[].policy`:
   ```yaml
   sources:
     - policy:
         - ./policy/lib                    # Local path
         - oci::quay.io/org/policy:latest  # OCI bundle
         - git::https://github.com/...     # Git URL
   ```

3. **Pull OCI policy bundles** if needed:
   ```bash
   # Create a working directory for policies
   mkdir -p .ec-debug-policies

   # For each OCI source, pull it
   conftest pull --policy .ec-debug-policies <oci-url>
   ```

4. **For local paths**: Resolve relative to the policy.yaml location
   - If policy.yaml is from GitHub, construct the raw URL for the policy directory
   - If policy.yaml is local, use the relative path from its directory

### If --setup-dir was provided:
Use `<setup-directory>/policy/` directly. The `/ec-setup` command creates a `policy/` subdirectory containing the pulled OCI bundle with `policy/release/...` structure.

### Otherwise, search in this order:

1. **Check for existing setup directories** created by `/ec-setup`:
   ```bash
   ls -d */ | grep -E '^[a-z]+-.*-[a-z0-9]+-[a-z0-9]+/$'
   ```
   The `/ec-setup` command creates directories named `<policy-name>-<image-name>-<arch>/` containing a `policy/` subdirectory with the pulled OCI bundles.

   If multiple setup directories exist, list them and ask the user which one to use, or use the most recently modified one.

2. **Local policy directory**: Check for `policy/release/` in the current directory (for local development or from conftest pull)

### If no policy source is found:

Tell the user:
```
No policy source code found. To debug violations, I need access to the policy Rego files.

Option 1: Provide the policy config
  /ec-debug-violations <log-file> --policy <policy.yaml or GitHub URL>
  This will read the config and pull the necessary policy bundles.

Option 2: Run /ec-setup first
  /ec-setup <log-file-path>
  This will extract the policy configuration and pull the OCI policy bundle.

Option 3: Specify the setup directory
  /ec-debug-violations <log-file> --setup-dir <directory>

Option 4: Pull policies manually
  conftest pull --policy . oci::quay.io/enterprise-contract/ec-release-policy:konflux
  This creates ./policy/release/... structure.
```

### Store the policy paths
Once found, store all policy base paths for use in subsequent steps. Policy rules may come from multiple sources:
- OCI bundles typically have `<pulled-dir>/release/<package>/` structure
- Local policies may have `<path>/<package>/` structure

When looking up a rule, search across all policy paths.

## Step 4: Debug Each Violation

For each unique violation code, perform the full debugging workflow from the ec-policy-debugging skill.

Use `<POLICY_BASE>` to refer to the policy path found in Step 3 (e.g., `./policy`, `./policies`, or `./release-policies-myimage-amd64/policies`).

### 4a. Parse the violation code
Split the code into `<package>.<short_name>`:
- Package name: First part (e.g., `olm`, `rpm_packages`, `cve`)
- Short name: Second part (e.g., `unmapped_references`, `unique_version`)

### 4b. Find the rule source file
Search across all policy paths for the package directory:
```bash
# For OCI-pulled policies (have release/ structure)
ls <POLICY_PATH>/release/<package>/

# For local policies (direct structure)
ls <POLICY_PATH>/<package>/

# Or search across all paths
find <POLICY_PATHS> -type d -name "<package>" 2>/dev/null
```

### 4c. Read the rule metadata
Find the METADATA block for the specific rule by searching for the short_name:
```bash
# Search in the package directory found in 4b
grep -B 30 "short_name: <short_name>" <PACKAGE_DIR>/<package>.rego
```

Extract and present:
- **Title**: Human-readable rule name
- **Description**: What the rule checks and why
- **Solution**: How to fix the violation
- **Failure message template**: The error message pattern

### 4d. Read the rule tests
Find test cases that show expected behavior:
```bash
grep -A 30 "test.*<short_name>" <PACKAGE_DIR>/<package>_test.rego
```

Explain what the tests reveal about:
- Expected data structure
- Conditions that pass
- Conditions that fail

### 4e. Analyze actual violations
From the parsed log, show:
- Which components/images triggered this violation
- The specific error messages
- Any `term` metadata indicating the specific failing item

## Step 5: Present Debugging Report

For each violation, present a structured debugging report:

```
================================================================================
VIOLATION: <package>.<short_name>
================================================================================

OCCURRENCES: <count> instances across <n> components

RULE METADATA:
  Title: <title from metadata>
  Description: <description from metadata>
  Solution: <solution from metadata>

AFFECTED COMPONENTS:
  - <component name>: <image ref>
    Message: <violation message>
  - ...

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
  <Based on the rule logic, tests, and violation messages, explain WHY this
  violation is occurring. What data is missing, malformed, or unexpected?>

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
  <Based on ACTUAL violation data, not generic rule metadata suggestions.
  Only recommend what is needed to fix the specific violations found.

  For example:
  - If violations show 2 unapproved registries, only list those 2 - not a
    generic list of 4 registries from the rule's solution text.
  - If a specific package version is missing, name that exact package.
  - Extract the minimum required fix from the actual violation terms/messages.>

INVESTIGATION COMMANDS:
  # Commands to investigate further
  <relevant cosign/crane/jq commands for this specific violation type>

================================================================================
```

## Step 6: Summary

After analyzing all violations, provide:

1. **Total unique violation types**: Count of distinct violation codes
2. **Total violation instances**: Sum of all violations across all components
3. **Priority ranking**: Order violations by:
   - Count (most frequent first)
   - Severity (failures before warnings)
4. **Common patterns**: Any patterns across violations (e.g., same image, same rule category)
5. **Quick wins**: Violations that appear easiest to fix based on the solutions

## Additional Context

### Recommendations must be data-driven
When providing recommended actions:
- Extract specific values from the actual violation messages and `term` fields
- Do NOT copy generic solution text from rule metadata verbatim
- Only recommend the minimum changes needed to fix the actual violations
- If a rule suggests "add X, Y, Z, or W" but violations only involve X and Y, only recommend X and Y

### Violation severity levels
- **Violations** (failures): Block the pipeline, must be fixed
- **Warnings**: Advisory, may become failures in the future

### If the user asks for more detail on a specific violation
Use the full ec-policy-debugging skill methodology:
1. Read the complete rule source code
2. Read all related tests
3. Download and inspect the actual attestation/SBOM data
4. Compare expected vs actual data structures
